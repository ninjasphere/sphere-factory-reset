Ninja Sphere Factory Build Package
==================================

This directory contains the media required to support the firmware flashing of Ninja Spheres by the Innocomm factory.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a step of the flashing process that needs to be conducted for each sphere (or components of each sphere) in the order that the process must be executed within the construction life cycle of a single sphere.

A manifest of all files is found in the file called factory.manifest. This file contains the SHA1 hash of each file in the distribution and can be used to check that a complete set of files with known contents has been received.

The verifier-osx or verfier-win32.exe tools can be used to verify that you have received the correct versions of each file. Run the tools with an argument of --sha1-manifest=factory.manifest.

The subdirectories are:

01-SOM
------
The files required to flash a SOM with a boot loader that can be used to put the SOM into DFU mode.

02-NAND
-------
No longer used - all NAND flashing now done by 01-SOM.

03-SDCARD
---------
The files required to perform a factory reset of a built sphere. These files should boot copied into the root
directory of a FAT partition on a USB memory stick.

04-TEST
-------
The files required to perform a factory test of a factory reset sphere.

Hardware and Software Requirements
==================================

01-SOM
------
Requirements:

1. FTDI cable
2. FTDI device driver downloaded from here - http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm (optional)
3. A terminal program like PuTTY - http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
4. Micro SD Card (>1GB) with formatted FAT boot partition of 100MB in size
5. NinjaSphere DevKit.
6. Supply of blank 512MB SOMs

02-NAND
-------
No longer used - all NAND flashing now done by 01-SOM.

03-SDCARD
---------
Requirements:

1. Assembled Ninja Sphere with blank 4GB SDCards installed and SOMs to which '02-NAND' process has been applied.
2. USB thumbdrive with 1GB FAT partition containing the contents of the 03-SDCARD directory and all subdirectories thereof.

04-TEST
-------
Requirements:

1. Assembled NinjaSphere to which the '03-SDCARD' process has been applied
2. A windows host with contents of ninjasphere-factory-test-windows-*.zip unpacked.

Process Steps
=============

01-SOM
------
This process formats the NAND on the SOM with a boot loader and a recovery operating system used to assist with
factory resets. The process is driven by a specially crafted SDCARD which contains a boot loader which is configured
to copy files from the SDCARD into the NAND, followed by a NAND boot which turns green LEDs on when the process is complete.
If the process fails for any reason, the green LEDS will not be switched on and the SOM should be put aside for further
investigation.

Setup Steps
-----------
1. Setup a Devkit

2. Orient the board

	Orient the board so that the EtherNet jack is to the right, the SOM slot to the left, the power jack at the top

3. (Optionally) Connect an FTDI cable to the USB port on the host machine and the FTDI pins next to the NetVox chip on the devkit.

	a. In default orientation, the FTDI cable should be connected to the 6-pin FTDI connector on the bottom of the board

	b. The (black) ground lead of the FTDI cable should be connected to the pin closest to the Netvox module

4. Unpack the contents of the zip file in 01-SOM into the root partition of the SDCARD

5. Install the formatted SDCARD in the DevKit's Micro SDCARD slot

6. Install FTDI driver and PuTTY software on the Windows host machine to which the FTDI cable is attached.

Per Unit Steps
--------------
1. Confirm that the devkit power is off
2. Insert blank SOM into slot
3. Power on the devkit
4. Wait for 2 minutes
5. After 2 minutes the LEDs on the Devkit should turn solid green.
6. Power off the devkit
7. Remove the formatted SOM from the slot
8. Repeat the process for a new blank SOM by going to step 1

If the LEDs do not go green after 2 minutes, use PuTTY and the FTDI cable to review the output from the process.

02-NAND
-------
This process is no longer used since all NAND flashing now done by the '01-SOM' process.

03-SDCARD
---------
This process performs a factory reset of the device using recovery media read from a USB key. This process requires a working SOM that has been provisioned with a boot loader and recovery operating system as produced by the '01-SOM' process described above. At the end of the process, the sphere's SDCARD will be formatted with a copy of the runtime operating system and all firmware will have been flashed.

On factory images without zigbee radio's installed, the file:

	factory-reset-packages/sphere-disable-zigbee_1.0~trustyspheramid-2_armhf.deb

should be present on the USB during the 03-SDCARD phase of the flashing. All parts of the test
process relating to the testing of the Zigbee radio will be disabled.

Setup Steps
-----------
1. Format a USB thumb drive with 1GB of space with a FAT file system
2. Copy all the files and directories into 03-SDCARD onto the root partition of the USB thumbdrive

Per Unit Steps
--------------
1. Confirm power to the sphere is off and all cables and peripherals are disconnected.
2. Insert the USB thumb drive into the slot of the sphere
3. Press and hold the reset button at the base of the sphere
4. Insert the power cord
5. Wait 5 seconds
6. Release the reset button
7. Wait 60 seconds for LED status codes to appear

    The process will continue for at least 10 minutes until 9999 is displayed.

    The system will then reboot to the SDCARD and install firmware. This process takes 2-3 minutes.

    The system will then reboot to the SDCARD a second time and should eventually display a phone icon.

8. Remove power from the sphere.
9. Remove the USB from the sphere.
10. Repeat the process for a new sphere at step 2.

04-TEST
-------
This process runs some acceptance tests on sphere's that have been produced by the '03-SDCARD' process. In particular, it collects
various hardware and software identifiers from the device and runs a collection of automated and semi-automated test cases. During
the semi-automated tests, the operator is expected to perform an action (tap - in test 0010) or confirm the integrity of the led matrix display or underlight (tests 0030 -> 0050) and then either confirm or reject the test with the left (confirm) or right (reject) mouse button.

Setup Steps
-----------

1. Unpack the zip files in the 04-TEST directory into directory on a Windows machine (e.g. c:\NinjaFactory\04-TEST)

Steps Per Shift
---------------
2. For each operator and com port:

    a. run the test_run.bat file

    b. enter the COM port to be used for this instance (e.g. COM10, COM11 or whatever)

    c. scan the operator id

Steps Per Sphere
----------------
3. For each sphere scanned by each operator.

    a. scan the serial id of the first sphere

    b. Connect the mini-USB and USB mouse cable to the sphere under test

    c. Connect the power cable to the sphere under test

    d. Wait for the 0010 (tap) symbol to appear

    e. Perform tests 0010, 0030, 0040 and 0050.

4. When the operator goes off shift, they should enter QUIT for the next serial number.

    This will cause the program to exit and allow the next operator to enter the COM port of each TTY
    device and the operator ID.

REVISION HISTORY
----------------
* 1.0.21
		* Updated recovery image to reflect March 9, 2016 build
		* Included sphere-disable-zigbee package for factory installs.

* 1.0.19
		* Updated NAND to e0530dcf1638904cd0c7135352ea1293b5f09b9a

* 1.0.18
		* Updated NAND to b800a427e68fc1574221221d868dd2809575a79e
		* First boot following factory NAND flash checks for block errors outside UBI controlled areas of NAND.

* 1.0.17d
		* Updated 01-SOM with new revB of SOM flashing media, specifically:

			factory-sdcard-1fc302821e7ca96a15cf8a851529211cfc9781ea-revB.zip

		* Only writes to extent of source image, tolerates small number of block errors in NAND during rootfs write.

* 1.0.17c
	  Updated ninjasphere-factory-reset (1.0.22) with fixes for:
	  	* id nand - was blank
	  	* ensure test 0010 always paints green on success
	  	* change order of MES commands from 1,2,3,5,6 to 1,2,5,6,3

* 1.0.17b
      Updated ninjasphere-factory-test (1.0.21) with modified test 0010.

      This test now requires the operator to wipe their hand over the sphere, as if wiping it, until the LED matrix turns
      from red to green. If it does not turn green after persistent swiping then there is likely a broken antenna and
      the test should be failed by tapping the sphere once or waiting for the test to timeout.

      This version of the test controller software used in the 04-TEST process now reports captured serial identifiers and
      MAC addresses to the MES program using cmd id 6.

* 1.0.17a
      Updated ninjasphere-factory-test (1.0.19) with improved support for detecting faulty antennas (test 0010)
